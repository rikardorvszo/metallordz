                                  was born Erzebet Bathory to a wealthy and prominent 
                                  family. She was the daughter of the Baron and 
                                  Baroness George and Anna Bathory. Highly educated, 
                                  fluent in Hungarian, German and Latin. </p>
                                <p class="boxcontent"> Engaged to Ferenc Nadasdy, 
                                  the &quot;Black Hero of Hungary&quot; at age

                                <p class="boxcontent">Because the Nadasdy family 
                                  was of a lesser social status, Elizabeth kept 
                                  her name and her husband hyphenated his. Elizabeth 
                                  went to live with her future mother-in-law and 
                                  while there, a brief affair with a commoner 
                                  which produced a daughter, who was given, along 
                                  with money, to a commoner. </p>

                                <p class="boxcontent">While getting ready for 
                                  her husband's homecoming, Elizabeth was being 
                                  helped by one of her maids. The maid saw that 
                                  something was wrong with Elizabeth's hair dress, 
                                  but when she went to fix it, Elizabeth hit her 
                                  with a brush. So hard in fact, that blood was 
                                  drawn. Some of the maid's blood fell onto Elizabeth, 
                                  who cleaned it away in disgust. However, Elizabeth 
                                  noticed that the skin below the blood seemed 
                                  to be younger and more vibrant. </p>

                                  common blood, turned to that of royalty, who 
                                  were missed more than their commoner counterparts.

                                  perhaps others. A maid, identified as &quot;Zusanna&quot;

                                  26. The count added her surname to his, so the 
                                  countess kept her name. They lived at Castle 
                                  Csejthe in the Nyitra country of Hungary. The

                                  fighting. His nickname was &quot;The Black Hero 
                                  of Hungary&quot;. While he was away, Elizabeth's 
                                  manservant Thorko introduced her to the occult. 
                                  Elizabeth eloped with a dark stranger briefly, 
                                  but came home. Luckily the count forgave her.

                                  her domineering mother-in-law. She began torturing

                                  Iloona Joo. Her other accomplices included the

                                  witch named Darvula and a witch Dorottya Szentes.

                                  First, she sent her hated mother-in-law away. 
                                  Elizabeth was very vain and afraid of getting 
                                  old and losing her beauty. One day a servant 
                                  girl accidentally pulled her hair while combing 
                                  it -- Elizabeth slapped the girl's hand so hard 
                                  she drew blood, which fell onto her own hand. 
                                  She immediately though her skin took on the 
                                  freshness of that of her young maid. She was 
                                  sure she found the secret of eternal youthful 
                                  skin. She had her major-domo and Thorko strip 
                                  the maid, cut her and drain her blood into a 
                                  huge vat. Elizabeth bathed in it to beautify 
                                  her entire body. </p>
                                <p class="boxcontent">Over the next 10 years Elizabeth's 
                                  evil henchmen provided her with new girls for 
                                  the blood-draining ritual and her blood baths. 
                                  But one of her intended victims escaped and 
                                  told the authorities about what was happening 
                                  at Castle Csejthe. King Mathias of Hungary ordered 
                                  Elizabeth's own cousin, Count Cuyorgy Thurzo, 
                                  governor of the province to raid the castle. 
                                  On December 30, 1610 they raided Castle Csejthe. 
                                  They were horrified by the terrible sights in 
                                  the castle - one dead girl in the main room, 
                                  drained of blood and another alive whose body 
                                  had been pierced with holes; in the dungeon 
                                  they discovered several living girls, some of 
                                  whose bodies had been pierced. Below the castle, 
                                  they exhumed the bodies of some 50 girls. </p>
                                <p class="boxcontent">Elizabeth was put under 
                                  house arrest. A trial was held in 1611 at Bitcse. 
                                  She refused to plead guilty or innocent and 
                                  never appeared at the trial. A complete transcript 
                                  of the trial was made at the time and it still 
                                  exists today in Hungary.Johannes Ujvary, major-domo, 
                                  testified that about 37 unmarried girls had 
                                  been killed, six of whom he had personally recruited 
                                  to work at the castle. The victims were tied 
                                  up and cut with scissors. Sometimes the two 
                                  witches tortured these girls, or the Countess 
                                  herself. Elizabeth's old nurse testified that 
                                  about 40 girls had been tortured and killed.</p>
                                <p class="boxcontent">All the people involved 
                                  in the killings, except the Countess Bathory 
                                  and the two witches were beheaded and cremated. 
                                  The two accomplices had their fingers torn out 
                                  and were burned alive. The court never convicted 
                                  Countess Elizabeth of any crime. Stonemasons 
                                  were brought to Castle Csejthe to wall up the 
                                  windows and doors of the bedchamber with the 
                                  Countess inside. They left a small hole through 
                                  which food could be passed. King Mathias II 
                                  demanded the death penalty for Elizabeth but 
                                  because of her cousin, the prime minister, he 
                                  agreed to an indefinitely delayed sentence, 
                                  which really meant solitary confinement for 
                                  life. </p>
                                <p class="boxcontent">In 1614, four years after 
                                  she was walled in, one of the guards wanted 
                                  a look at this famous beauty. He saw her lying 
                                  face down on the floor. Elizabeth Bathory, the 
                                  &quot;Blood Countess&quot; was dead. </p>
                                <p class="boxcontent">There are some connections 
                                  between the Bathorys and the Dracula's. The 
                                  commander of the expedition that helped Dracula 
                                  regain his throne in 1476 was Prince Steven 
                                  Bathory. A Dracula fief, Castle Fagaras, became 
                                  a Bathory possession during the time of Elizabeth. 
                                  Both families had a dragon design on their family 
                                  crests. </p>
                                <p class="boxcontent">One thing I found out was 
                                  that the Countess, as a small child (4 or 5) 
                                  used to have quite violent seizures where she 
                                  would pass out. I do not think this was epilepsy, 
                                  but most likely some other neurological disorder 
                                  that may help to explain her horrific behaviour 
                                  as a young woman. The second thing is that when 
                                  her husband, the Count, was alive, he loaned 
                                  a large sum of money to the government. After 
                                  his death, and once the discovery of Elizabeth's 
                                  grisly activities was made, the government decided 
                                  that another reason to wall her up in her castle 
                                  was to avoid having to pay back the debt they 
                                  owned to her estate. </p>
                                <p class="boxcontent"> There have been many pictures 
                                  of The Countess, but which one is the real one?? 
                                </p>

                                  really puzzles me because her apperance is that 
                                  of a woman from India, also the art is very 
                                  similar to that of Inidan paintings, if you 
                                  look at the shape of the mouth, nose, eyes,
